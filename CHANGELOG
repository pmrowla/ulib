Changelogs
-------------------------------------
01/02/2012
	1. Fixed a bug in map-reduce that a reset is needed after mapping
	every data set record. And the mr_bench utility uses chainhash
	instead to check the correctness. Aligned hashmap would be
	problematic because the key class has virtual functions.

12/30/2012	1.2.2 was released
	1. Fixed the compiling problem for some tests.
	2. Reformatted the source code and added more comments to improve
	the readability.
	3. Improved the map-reduce framework performance when a mapper
	produces multiple pairs for a single data record.

12/02/2012	1.2.1 was released
	1. Added new features such as chainhash,  reentrant chainhash_r,
	and etc.
