ulib implements efficient data structures and algorithms in C and
C++. Most of them are competitively efficient as compared to
state-of-the-art.

ulib is an aggregate work based on several undergraduate projects of
mine, as well as some popular open source projects like the Linux
kernel.

The project is hosted at: http://code.google.com/p/ulib
