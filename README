	Introducing ULIB
===========================================================================

1. What is ULIB?
   Basically, ulib is a collection of common data structures and
   algorithms. It is featured in several aspects. Most importantly,
   ulib is quite efficient. In particular, the implementations have
   better or similar performance than state-of-the-art libraries.
   Secondly, the interface of ulib is designed to be flexible. The
   design follows the linux kernel style: minimized interface with
   maximum control.

	Core Components
===========================================================================

    1. A simple doubly linked list, this can also be used as queue and
       stack.
    2. An extremely efficient hashing scheme - alignhash, both
       hash_map and hash_set are provided. Both C and C++ versions are
       provided.
    3. Various trees, such as binary search tree, splay tree,
       red-black tree and AVL tree.
    4. A list sorting algorithm, this is faster than the qsort() in
       libc.
    5. A binary search algorithm for text files. It works with
       line-sorted text files.
    6. A heap and the corresponding sorting algorithm, this is faster
       than the STL version.
    7. A partition algorithm, this partitions an array into three
       parts |<=K| K |>= K|, O(1) complexity.
    8. A collection of fast hash functions for various data types.
    9. Primitives for random number generation. Especially useful for
       designing numerical algorithms.
    10. A collection of bit operation hacks. Especially useful for
       numerical algorithms and cryptography.
    11. A full featured bitmap and its derivate bloom filter.
    12. Several cryptographic algorithms, namely Advanced Encryption
    	Standard(AES), RC4, SHA-x, MD5 etc.
    13. A collection of string utilities, including primitives for
    	parallel file process.
    14. Various utilities, including high resolution timer,
    	user-defined shell, combination enumerator.
