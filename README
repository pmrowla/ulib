Aligned Hashing
	An extremely efficient hashing scheme. Both Map and Set
	versions are provided in alignhash.h. The properties of aligned
	hashing includes:
	1. CPU cache-conscious layout. A bitmap index is used to
	support fast data location especially for sparse key
	distributions.
	2. Aligned data access. The bucket for a set/search operation
	is located through logical AND not %. This implies an
	significant improvement on searching.
	3. Tier-probing, a technique based on double hashing.
